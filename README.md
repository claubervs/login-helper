# login-helper
Login Helper is a software to automatically login into windows and can also auto-lock upon successful login. This is not developed by me and is no longer available on the internet or the Author Website. Original Author is Kiril Galabov and his website was http://www.miscsoft.net. Other download links I found were malware infested or earlier versions.
